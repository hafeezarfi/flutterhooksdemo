# flutterhooksdemo

<b>React Hooks</b> approach with Dart for Flutter sample.

## Getting Started

This project is about several hook methods which if used properly can reduce redundency and can be used to avoid statefulness when using stream, any controllers etc.

## Key Points
- <b>HookWidget</b> which extends StatelessWidget
- useEffect, useMemoized, useFuture, useLisnables, useAnimationController, useScrollController, useStreamController, useReducer, useAppLifecycleState
